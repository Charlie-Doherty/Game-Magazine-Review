Super Mario Odyssey is a game that someone can play for hours on end without even feeling like time has passed, so many scenes will give you child-like flashbacks, remembering older games like 64 and galaxy, while still being completely original. While playing, no matter what age you will feel like a child playing this game, from its excellent narration to its stellar gameplay. This game had me in a trance from start to finish.
		
Pros- Comedic story, easily replayable, Many unlockable cosmetics, Fluid movement, Incredible music.
		
Cons- the game can feel too easy at times, Difficulty spikes can be annoying but nothing too hard, motion controls.

I will say this now, I love this game. The game itself is very different from it's predecessors, being more open world it's still packed with things to do while having it's own unique challenges and secrets in each world. I have played the game three times, hundred percented the game the third time and have beaten the two extra world and unlike other games that make me overwhelmed with the things that I need to do Odyssey doesn't, the way the game feels makes you determined and confident that you will be able to do it. The game is very nostalgic for me, it is like playing Mario as a child for the first time, the feeling of happiness soared higher when I saw levels that were just like the 2-D platformers I played as a child, when I played them for the first time and knew I would love this game.

Thank you, Nintendo and anyone who helped work on the game and I am looking forward to your next Mario game.

I've been playing Mario since I was a little girl and have always really enjoyed it. But this is the BEST GAME I have ever came across. I've been playing it for months and have had my husband help me and still only at 789 moons. There's so many challenges and so many really cool features in this game. I mean from the moment you start playing it, it's just never ends. Every kingdom is so unique and some moons are really challenging, while others are just super fun! Seriously THE BEST GAME EVER MADE!

An amazing game from beginning to end. In typical Nintendo fashion a beloved franchise is given a fresh coat of paint with updated graphics and a verity of new gameplay features. This game is a spiritual successor to Mario 64, Sunshine, Galaxy 1&2. If you enjoyed any of those games then you will love Odyssey. I loved how the concept of worlds were utilized in this title as well as the new power-ups. Is it perfect? No, but no game is however it is for sure worth every penny full priced or discounted.

Best Mario game in years! This game should have been Game of the Year for 2017! But unfortunately, The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild took 1st place..... BUT, this game took 2nd place and for the Best Platformer. First off, this game is 1080p quality, it never drops. Trying to find all 999 Power Moons is challenging and fun. The costumes are awesome and have a lot of references to older games in the past. The story is also very easy to follow! Anyways, this game is an awesome game one way or the other!

Ever since I was a kid, I looked up to Mario as a brave hero who never gives up, and that belief is proven with Mr. Video Game's latest adventure. Mario Odyssey was and always will be the best game of 2017 for me. The character design, worlds, and incredible soundtrack give the game so much replay value. All of the collectibles always had me going back into the game to search for more moons and purple coins. Miyamoto's legendary creation will always stand out to me as the best game on the Switch.

Super Mario Odyssey. One of the best games I've ever played along with Ocarina of Time and Mario 64, if you ignore the camera in the latter game. This game probably has Mario's most fluid move set. You do all the tricks from the previous 3D games except for the spin jump from Galaxy. And, you can jump throw your cap, and then dive onto it for extra height and distance. Oh yeah, and Cappy in this game! "Cap"turing enemies in game is so satisfying when you do something like hit a torch far away with a Fire Bro, or smashing a wall with a Chain Chomp. 10/10 This is a must have game fir your Nintendo Switch!

I love Super Mario Odyssey. It is one of the best Mario games of all time. It uses a lot of aspects from really great Mario games like Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine and even Super Mario World for the SNES. It has a bunch of things to do so you never get bored of the game. There is so much creativity on this game that it's just mind-blowing. The graphics on this game are amazing. It's a great time killer. If Nintendo makes an even better Mario game, I'm definitely playing it.

BEST MARIO GAME EVER! Great Controls, Great Story, Great Elements. Literally Everything About This Game Is Beautiful. It's Way Better Than Mario Sunshine! Although The Game Is Kinda Short But I Don't Mind Replaying Through The Game Over And Over And Even If You Are Done With The Game The Fun Will Never Ever End. If You Are A Nintendo Switch Owner You Have To Own This Game Because It Is Literally The Best Video Game Ever!

I played over 3000 hours to find every moon and do everything. This game makes you want to collect more and more moons. It's story is perfect and there are no flaws but once you collect everything it gets a bit boring.... if you don't internet! Luigi's Balloon World makes you come back to find more balloons. It's a genius way to pull players to play more. Overall 10/10 game. Better gameplay than Super Mario 3D World.
